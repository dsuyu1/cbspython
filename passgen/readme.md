# passgen
A simple password generator that I built to help me ease myself into learning Python while making something relevant to cybersecurity.
## Overview
Often, in cybersecurity, we hear that humans are the weakest link in the security chain. As awesome as we may think we are, we are very susceptible to losing, forgetting,
or even worse, making weak passwords. A password generator that makes us strong passwords will help us to avert the trouble of making strong passwords ourselves.

## Objective
For my first Python/cybersecurity project, I decided to make a password generator. I will walk through step-by-step what each piece of code does. I aim to:
- Deepen my understanding of Python and cybersecurity topics
- Become more comfortable writing in Python
